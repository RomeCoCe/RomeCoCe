# Welcome
**Hi, I’m Rome! I am a web and mobile developer.

Specializing in web and mobile developmenet with over a decade of experience, my journey has been one of constant evolution, both professionally and personally. My name is Rome, and I've always been fascinated by the ever-changing landscape of technology. From my early days tinkering with computers to my current role as a father and educator, my passion for web development has been the driving force behind my endeavors.

Over the years, I've had the opportunity to work on a myriad of projects, from small startups to large corporations, honing my expertise in front-end and back-end development, as well as mastering various programming languages and frameworks.

While my professional life was thriving, my personal life underwent a significant transformation with the arrival of my children. Becoming a father not only brought immense joy and fulfillment but also sparked a newfound desire to make a positive impact beyond the confines of my career. I realized that there was a gap in education when it came to teaching children about technology, particularly web development.

Having left the corporate world, and driven by this new-found realization, I embarked on a new mission—to bridge the gap between my passion for web development and my desire to educate the next generation of innovators. I became a youth coding instructor.

Drawing upon my years of experience and expertise, I strive to ignite a spark of curiosity and creativity in young minds, empowering them to explore the boundless possibilities of technology. Whether it's teaching them how to design their first website or showing them how to code their own interactive games, witnessing the excitement and sense of accomplishment on their faces is truly priceless.

As I continue on this journey of education and empowerment, my ultimate goal is to inspire the next generation of web developers, innovators, and problem-solvers. By sharing my knowledge and passion with young minds, I hope to equip them with the skills and confidence they need to thrive in an increasingly digital world. And as a father, there's no greater joy than knowing that I'm helping to shape a brighter future for my children and generations to come.
